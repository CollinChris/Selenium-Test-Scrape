Trying to follow along this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PvsGyAghDg&list=PLq1YsG1H2jMUlJcRexo2JBbo2fK5T6oJe&index=8
Currently I'm stuck at soup.find_all, even though I inspected the page and found the element I was searching for on the script and in the video, the list returns empty unlike the video and I'm not sure how 
to fix this part of the code
